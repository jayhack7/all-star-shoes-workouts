        He shows us what it means to have no days off with countless hours of hard work put in and off the court.\n
        In many of his most loyal fan’s eyes, he will go down as the greatest basketball player of all time. </string>
    <string name="bio_jordan">
By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. However, his impact is far greater than awards and championships.
        He burst into the league as a rookie sensation scoring in droves with an unmatchable first step and acrobatic drives and dunks and concluded his career as a cultural icon.
        Along the way, he became a true champion who spearheaded the globalization of the NBA with his dynamic on court abilities and personal sense of style that was marketed to the masses.
